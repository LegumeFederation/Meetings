# This is the title of Sam's talk at the 2018 PAG *Interoperability and Federation Across Bioinformatic Platforms and Resources* workshop.

This is the abstract of Sam's talk at the 2018 PAG *Interoperability and Federation Across Bioinformatic Platforms and Resources* workshop.
It will presumably have something to do with the wonderful federated bioinformatic resources provided by the Legume Federation.
Will it be another task-solving demo? Or a meta-talk ABOUT task-solving demos? A list of our great tools? Details on how we
interconnect resources? The sky's the limit! (As long as the sky can be talked about in 15 minutes.)
